This is my first project in GitHub. In this project, I will show my own solutions to the problems on Rosalind. In addition, I'm not so familiar with GitHub, so I also want to learn some skills of using GitHub by doing this project. I will try to solve problems once a day and keep updating my solution untill the last problem solved.

Rosalind is an educational resource and web project for learning bioinformatics through problem solving and computer programming.(Web of Rosalind: https://rosalind.info/problems/locations/)
