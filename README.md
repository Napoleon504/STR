This is my first project in GitHub. In this project, I will show my own solutions to the problems of Rosalind. In addition, I'm not so familiar with GitHub, so I also want to learn some skills of using GitHub by doing this project.
Rosalind is an educational resource and web project for learning bioinformatics through problem solving and computer programming.
